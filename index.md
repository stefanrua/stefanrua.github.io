## Hey, it's me!

Thanks to [Otto A. Laitinen](https://www.flickr.com/people/oalaitinen/) for this picture.

**Stefan Rua** is my name and this is my website. There isn't much on this page
yet, so I suggest having a look at [my photos](photos.html) instead.

You can also check out [the code for this
page](https://github.com/stefanrua/stefanrua.github.io), although there isn't
much code to see as the whole page is just compiled to html from markdown using
*pandoc*.
