My major is in Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.  I
did my bachelor's thesis on feature selection for low sample sizes of high
dimensional cancer cell data using dimensionality reduction and clustering
methods. The goal was to find a better set of features for
[comboLTR](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34252952/), a machine learning
method for finding new drug combinations. Sandor Szedmak from Juha Rousu's
group was my instructor.
