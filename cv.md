## Education

**Aalto University** \
Computer Science \
B.Sc (2022) \
M.Sc (ongoing)

My major is in Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I
did my bachelor's thesis on feature selection for cancer cell data using
dimensionality reduction and clustering methods. The goal was to find a better
set of features for [comboLTR](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34252952/), a
machine learning method for finding new drug combinations.
